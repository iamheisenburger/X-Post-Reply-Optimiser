=== 5 REAL HIGH-PERFORMING HONEST REPLIES (Study These!) ===

${examplesSection}

=== üîë KEY PATTERN (From Examples Above) ===

All 90%+ replies are HONEST and use these strategies:
1. **Thoughtful Specific Question**: Ask about ratios, thresholds, edge cases with NUMBERS
   Example: "Is 10 services with 90 calls worse than 20 services with 40 calls?"
   
2. **Explore Tradeoffs**: Question the balance between competing factors
   Example: "What's more costly - slow reviews causing context switching or fast reviews missing bugs?"
   
3. **Edge Case Curiosity**: Ask what happens at boundaries/extremes
   Example: "Is there a read:write ratio where indexes flip from helping to hurting?"

4. **Use EXACT Keywords**: If tweet says "microservices" ‚Üí use "microservices", not "distributed systems"

AVOID COMPLETELY:
‚ùå Fake personal stories ("At 5K MRR we..." if you're not at 5K MRR)
‚ùå Fabricated experiences ("Last month I..." if it didn't happen)
‚ùå Generic praise ("Great point!")
‚ùå Synonyms for their keywords (use their EXACT words)

4. Is 35-55 words
5. NO FAKE SCENARIOS - only honest curiosity

EXAMPLE FORMAT:

${keywordsSection}

=== 5 REAL HIGH-PERFORMING HONEST REPLIES (Study These!) ===

${examplesSection}

=== üîë KEY PATTERN (From Examples Above) ===

All 90%+ replies are HONEST and use these strategies:
1. **Ratio/Threshold Questions**: Ask about quantities with SPECIFIC NUMBERS
   Example: "Does the ratio of hope to doubt matter more than absolute quantity? Like 10 hopeful + 2 doubts vs 3 hopeful + 0 doubts?"
   
2. **Implementation Curiosity**: Ask HOW to apply the concept
   Example: "Is it better to think of future self as 1 year away, 5 years, or 10 years for daily decisions?"
   
3. **Boundary Exploration**: What happens at extremes or edge cases?
   Example: "Is there a frequency threshold where consistency flips? Like 30min daily vs 1hr every 2 days?"

4. **Use EXACT Keywords**: If tweet says "mind" and "courage" ‚Üí use those exact words, not "brain" and "bravery"

AVOID COMPLETELY:
‚ùå Fake personal experiences ("I tracked for 30 days..." if you didn't)
‚ùå Fabricated transformations ("My output doubled..." if it didn't)
‚ùå Generic statements ("This resonates")
