## 📋 Optional Enhancements

### Twitter API (Optional - $5/month)

**Only if you want to:**
- Auto-fetch follower counts
- Get recent tweets from targets
- Calculate engagement rates automatically

**Without API, you can still:**

**To add Twitter API:**
1. Sign up at [twitterapi.io](https://twitterapi.io)
2. Get API key
3. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```env
   TWITTER_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```
4. Restart dev server

**Cost:** ~$0.41 for entire 30-day challenge (way under $5 minimum)

### Deploy to Vercel (Optional - Free)

**When ready to go live:**

1. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
2. Import from GitHub: `X-Post-Reply-Optimiser`
3. Add environment variables:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://brave-owl-955.convex.cloud
   CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=prod:brave-owl-955
   ```
4. Deploy! (Auto-deploys on every git push)

See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for full guide.

   - @levelsio, @marc_louvion, @JonYongfook
   - For reach & network effects

   - High engagement rates

3. **20 Mid-Tier** (10-50K)
   - More likely to engage with you
   - Building relationships

4. **10 Growing** (1-10K)
   - Mutual support
   - Similar journey

### Content Strategy - Day 1
**Post 1 (Morning):** Announce your 30-day challenge
```
I'm going from 3 → 250 followers in 30 days while 
training for MMA and building @usesubwise to 50 users.

Here's my exact playbook (and the tool I built to track it): 👇

[Optimization score: Aim for 75+]
```

**Post 2 (Evening):** First lesson learned
```
Day 1 of my 30-day challenge:

Built an X reply optimizer using Twitter's open-source 
algorithm. Discovered replies are weighted 13.5x vs 
likes at 0.5x.

Here's what this means for your content: 👇

[Share 1-2 actionable insights]

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Convex not working"
```bash
# Re-run setup
npx convex dev --prod brave-owl-955
```

### "Port 3000 already in use"
```bash
# Kill process or use different port
npm run dev -- -p 3001
```

### "Missing environment variables"
Check `.env.local` exists and has:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://...
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=prod:...
```
